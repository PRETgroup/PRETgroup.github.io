            "research_interests": "My main research interests is in the area of real-time embedded systems. These are ubiquitous computing systems that have challenging design issues in both hardware and software fronts. Of particular interest to me are systems in industrial control such as airport baggage handling and other complex material handling systems. I am also looking at several design challenges in embedded systems such as the static timing analysis of embedded code, design of processors that guarantee precise timing and the design of complex systems on a chip (SoC) by automatically combining many pre-verified IP blocks. An interesting project that combines many of these challenges is the design of interactive indoor sports environments and we are developing such environments at UoA. I have proposed a family of processors called reactive processors which are specifically designed for reactive embedded applications."
