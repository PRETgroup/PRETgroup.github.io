<h2>BlokIDE</h2>
<p>
    BlokIDE is an immersive design environment for Model-Driven Engineering of programmable electronics.
    Integration with the most efficient IEC 61499 compiler in the world allows BlokIDE to auto-generate ISO-C code that can run on a variety of platforms, ranging from Programmable ICs to Programmable Logic Controllers.

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Synchronous execution:</h4>
    Based on mathematically sound synchronous execution semantics, BlokIDE generates code that is deterministic and guaranteed to be causal-by-construction.
    The resultant systems and free from ambiguities, deadlocks and race conditions.
</p>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Formal verification:</h4>
    Formal verification is the name of applying mathematical techniques in order to prove or disprove the correctness of a system against an intended functional behaviour.
    BlokIDE integrates with formal verifiers and model checkers for ensured correct functional behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Static timing analysis:</h4>
    BlokIDE allows design of real-time applications, where the time taken to respond to the environment is extremely important.
    Static timing analysis computes the worst case execution time (WCET) of the systems, which can be used to determine if the timing requirements are met.

<h3>Additional features</h3>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Automatic code generation:</h4>
    BlokIDE is integrated with the worldâ€™s most efficient code generator for IEC 61499.
    The output of code generation is a set of human readable ISO-C files along with Makefile scripts, which compiles out of the box.
    The generated code does not require any runtime or scheduler and is compiled to a native binary executable.
    Due to a small memory footprint, the generated code can execute on a variety of devices ranging from light-weight Programmable ICs (PICs) to industrial Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).
</p>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Simulation:</h4>
    BlokIDE is equipped with a discrete-step design simulator for of IEC 61499 function blocks.
    The simulation is performed by generating simulation-ready code, which contains any external code that is included in the project e.g., a 3rd party pre-compiled library.
    A further enhanced mode of this feature enables hardware in-loop simulation in the presence of platform specific libraries.
    In addition to the visualization, a range of inspection tools are also available that are used to track values of various variables and events in the system.
</p>
<p>
    <h4 class="font-bold inline-block no-margin-bottom">Device deployment:</h4>
    The output of automatic code generation is compatible with a wide range of C compilers.
    Depending on the service interface function blocks used in a BlokIDE project, the generated code may be compiled into native x86 executables and run on the PC.
    However, in some cases the generated code may be platform-specific e.g., use of IO pins on a PLC.
    For such cases, the code must be compiled by a platform-specific GNU C Compiler (GCC).
    BlokIDE supports cross-compliers (e.g., avr-gcc) as well as onboard GCC for platform-specific compilation over SSH/SFTP connection.
