<p>
    Reactive processors provide an alternative approach to the typical polling or interrupt mechanisms used by conventional processors for environment interaction.
    They were first developed at Auckland University, with the the first paper on it appearing in 2002.
    In the following, we present three generations of reactive processors that have been developed at Auckland University.
    The first generation consisted of simple processors that had no support for concurrency.
    The second generation of reactive architectures supported concurrency through the use of multiple processor cores.
    The current generation of reactive processors (called the third generation) provides multithreading support within a single core.
    While this work was being carried out here, research on reactive processors have also been on-going at Kiel University since 2004.
    Their research had proposed the first multithreaded design for reactive processors.

    An embedded system typically interacts continuously with its adjoining environment through sensors and actuators.
    When implementing this interaction on conventional processors, inputs from the environmnet have traditionally been read through either polling or interrupt mechanisms.
    Polling is a simple procedure that checks for sensor values at regular intervals, irrespective of whether or not the sensor values have changed, resulting in a waste of CPU cycles, especially when sampling inputs that rarely change.
    Interrupts, on the other hand, combine preemption and priority in a single package, and are much more efficient compared to polling.
    The main drawbacks of interrupts, however, include:

    <ol>
        <li>The latency of an interrupt is highly unpredictable.</li>
        <li>The associated code is very complex and difficult to debug.</li>
    </ol>

    Reactive processors were motivated by the need for alternative architectures that provided more predictable and structured models of interactions with the environment.
